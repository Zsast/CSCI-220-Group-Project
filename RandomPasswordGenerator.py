# CSCI-220 Group Project: Random Password Generator
# Authors: Daniel Roberts, Caleb (lastname), Griffin (lastname)
# (Due Date)
# Course: CSCI-220-03-04
# Instructor: Dr. Mia Wang
# We certify that this project is entirely of our own collaborative work, with work shared through GitHub.

# The purpose of this program is to generate a randomized password
# depending on parameters such as the password's length, whether
# they wish to include special characters, and more. The password
# will resemble something like that of one generated by Google or Edge's
# "suggested password" feature when creating new online accounts.
